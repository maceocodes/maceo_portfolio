This is my final project for the Code Louisville Front-End Web Development Course.

In order to explore the site launch index.html and click the image on the homepage.  The work page is just a small image gallery containing my work.  Clicking on the thumbnails to the left will display an enlarged view of the same image on the right.  

The Connect page has what will simply be a contact form for potential clents.
